"""F1 Strategy game implemented in Python.

This is a simple demonstration of implementing a game in Python, featuring
chance and imperfect information.

Python games are significantly slower than C++, but it may still be suitable
for prototyping or for small games.

It is possible to run C++ algorithms on Python implemented games, This is likely
to have good performance if the algorithm simply extracts a game tree and then
works with that. It is likely to be poor if the algorithm relies on processing
and updating states as it goes, e.g. MCTS.
